                      The Principles of Wheel/Rail Interaction course
                    </span>{' '}
                    has been revitalized and reimagined with a tighter focus on
                    the practical aspects of wheel/rail and vehicle/track
                    interaction for 2025. The course will begin with a case
                    study — an examination of an actual wheel/rail
                    interaction-related derailment. Presenters will cover the
                    fundamental aspects of track, vehicle suspension systems,
                    damage mechanisms, measurements systems — all the topics we
                    have traditionally covered — but will also connect the dots
                    between theory and what actually happens in the field. A
                    wrap-up session will review the causes attributed to the
                    case study derailment in light of the Principles examined
                    throughout the course. We’ll also look at approaches that
                    can be taken to mitigate wheel/rail- and
                    vehicle/track-related derailments in the future.
